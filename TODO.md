* Around-Invariant through coproduct that isn't consistent before/after action.
* Test other combinations of {+>,<+} x {c,a}

* Repetition in error msg annoying:
      ✘ 1.1 text should be "No food? ← 1.1.1 → 1.0.2". -- Expected "No food? ← 1.1.1 → 1.0.2", not "No food?→1.0.2".


Maybe
=====
* Have .stateless called automatically in Plan/Test.
* Report user-defined `f` on failure.
* Nest invariant coproducts, display choice value in History.
* Show O and/or S on failure.
* Action to log O and/or S.
* Rename `S` for `State`. Might be confusing that it isn't the state being tested.
* JS module
* Replace c & c with {<+,+>}? Down to two symbolic ops.
