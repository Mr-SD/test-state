to testing stateful code.

* integration testing a webapp.
* testing DB state or a DB migration.
* random-testing like Android's monkeyrunner


* Scala & Scala.JS.
* Sync & Async (stack-safe).
* Test stateful, effectful code & stateless pure core.
* Property test (∀) & imperatively test (∃).
* Products & coproducts.
